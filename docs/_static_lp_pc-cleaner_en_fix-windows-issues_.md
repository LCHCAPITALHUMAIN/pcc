<p>Issue:</p>
<pre><code>                            As a computer ages, it tends to slow down; both in overall performance and in start-up time. This is due to system clutter and invalid or obsolete registry entries bogging down your computer’s health. System clutter and registry entries are leftover and unnecessary files that accumulate just by regular computer use.
</code></pre>
<p>Solution:
Use PC Cleaner to scan, find and delete system clutter and invalid or obsolete registry entries. Regular cleaning by PC Cleaner will speed up your PC, free up disk space, enhance performance, and even resolve unknown Windows problems. 
With PC Cleaner, unlike other computer cleaner programs, your credit card is not required to run a complete computer diagnosis and clean up!
